# ENGO-51-LAB2
In this project, we will create a web mapping framework for building permits in Calgary. Users will be able to filter and envision construction permits in Calgary in front-end mapping. I can use the City of Calgary Open Calgary API to extract data from building permits. Users will be able to query date ranges using the Open Calgary API.
